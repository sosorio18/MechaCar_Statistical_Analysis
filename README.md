# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 
  Ground_clearnace and vehicle_length provided a non-random amount of variance. 

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 
  By looking at our p-value, which is less than 0.05, we are able to say it is not considered to be zero. 

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  Being that the R-squared value is 71% and the adjusted is 68% we could conclude that this linear model predicts the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively.
